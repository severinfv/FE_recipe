            Georgia's rich culinary tradition is often overlooked. This small
            country on the eastern coast of the Black Sea was an important node
            on the Silk Road, which explains the similarities it shares with
            Persian cuisine.

            In Georgia, the concept of hospitality is deeply intertwined with
            its food culture. <i>Supras</i> are traditional multi-course feasts that
            unite families and friends in moments of celebration as well as
            mourning. No <i>supra</i> would be complete without these boldly flavoured
            aubergine rolls. They are a great way to take a first bite of the
            country's culinary heritage.

          <ul>
            <li>3 aubergines</li>
            <li>150 g wallnuts</li>
            <li>3 aubergines, about 900g (2lb)</li>
            <li>1¾ tsp salt</li>
            <li>150g (5½oz) walnuts</li>
            <li>3 large garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 tsp <a href="#notice">khmeli suneli</a></li>
            <li>2 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>100ml (6½ tbsp) vegetable (or olive) oil for frying</li>
            <li>a few sprigs of coriander</li>
            <li>20g (¾oz) pomegranate seeds</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="instructions">
          <ol>
            <li>
              Trim the aubergines and cut them lengthwise into 5mm (¼in) slices.
              The outermost slices won't make good rolls but can be fried and
              eaten as a chef's treat to taste the filling. Season the slices
              with 1 teaspoon of the salt and place in a colander in the sink to
              draw out excess moisture (the aubergine will absorb less oil in
              the pan as a result).
            </li>
            <li>
              In a small food processor, finely grind the walnuts, peeled
              garlic, khmeli suneli and remaining ¾ teaspoon salt. Add the
              vinegar and 100ml (6½ tablespoons) of water and blend to a
              spreadable paste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan and line a cooling
              rack with kitchen paper. Pat the aubergine slices dry, then fry
              them in batches until golden (2-3 minutes each side), adding more
              oil if the pan runs dry. Transfer to the paper-lined rack and
              continue with the rest. Meanwhile, trim and discard the lower
              stems of the coriander and finely chop the rest.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the aubergine slices have cooled a little, pat them again
              with kitchen paper to remove the excess oil. Spread a large
              teaspoon of the walnut mixture over each slice, roll it up and
              arrange on a platter. Sprinkle with the chopped coriander and
              pomegranate seeds and serve at room temperature.
            </li>

        <strong>Note:</strong><br />
        Khmeli suneli is a Georgian spice mix made with difficult-to-find
        ingredients including blue fenugreek, summer savoury, and ground
        marigold petals. Good-quality khmeli suneli is available online and in
        specialist spice stores. For a similar flavour, combine ½ tsp dried
        dill, ½ tsp dried marjoram, ½ tsp dried mint, ½ tsp dried parsley, ½ tsp
        dried tarragon, ⅛ tsp ground coriander, ⅛ tsp chilli powder, and ⅛ tsp
        ground fenugreek.
