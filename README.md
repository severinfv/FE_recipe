# Frontend - Intro HTML/CSS 
## Assignment
An intro assignment from Lexicon's Frontend Course: Create a simple webpage about a recipe. \
To make it a bit more challenging I attempted to recreate a minimalistic style from the [cookbook](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81EA-csRSXL._SL1500_.jpg) by [Julius Fiedler](https://bakinghermann.com/recipes/).

## Requirements

- A `<header>` element that contains a headline (`<h1>`–`<h6>`) and a short introduction to the recipe — maybe explain why you chose this particular one.

- At least **two images**, each with a proper `alt` attribute. You decide where and how to use them — but a cover image is usually a good idea. Feel free to find your images online.

- A clear section listing the ingredients using a bullet list. Required elements (but not limited to): `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`.

- A clear section listing the cooking instructions using a numbered list. Required elements (but not limited to): `<section>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`.

- A `<footer>` section with some contact info about yourself _(can be made up)_. Who knows, maybe a bakery or restaurant wants to hire you after seeing your delicious creation!

- Accessibility: Think about the basics of accessibility. Use proper heading levels `<h1>` followed by `<h2>`, etc. write descriptive alt text for all images, ensure good color contrast between text and background, and use semantic HTML elements wherever possible. Reserve `<div>` and` <span>` for layout and styling purposes only.

- After completing the HTML part, you must style your page properly. It doesn’t have to be fancy, and it doesn’t need to be responsive — but make it look as good as you can. Try to match the theme of your dish, using fitting colors and fonts.

## Result
I decided not to aim for a 100% replica of the original image from the cookbook. I focused on recreating the minimal layout, general color palette and meeting the assignment requirements, putting less emphasis to minor fonts and text color variations.
